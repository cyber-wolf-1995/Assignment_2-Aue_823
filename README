This repository contains ROS package for turtlesim movement in a circle (adapted from ref. 3) and a square. 

The code for traversing the square consists of both open loop and closed loop (adapted from ref. 2) tracing methods.

The circle accepts radius as user input.

The square open loop implementation uses functions for rotation and straight line motion.

The square closed loop implementation is a modification of the gotogoal code, where the velocity is proportional to the distance error from goal position. The proportionality constants are "1.2" in case of linear velocity and "9.5" for angular velocity.

"Working Videos" folder consists of videos that show the turtlesim working in the desired manner.
